            <h3 class="yellow">UX/UI DESIGN</h3>
            <h1>iDoctors</h1>
            <p>iDoctor is an online service that offers the possibility to book, quickly and conveniently, any health service on their preferred days, times and areas of the city. Its aim is to facilitate the doctor-patient encounter avoiding loss of time,
                waiting and appointments made at times that are problematic for the patients.<br>For this service I studied the UX of the site, both desktop and mobile, checking its usability, and then designed and proposed a new UI, going from creating
                new wireframes to making a prototype.<br><br>In this project I used Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator and Figma.

            <h3 class="yellow">1 - Discovery Phase</h3>
            <div class="text-center">
                <h4>AS IS ANALYSIS</h4>
                <p>During the first phase of analysis of the website, in both its desktop and mobile versions, I started with an assessment of the usability of the website itself, following the "Jakob Nielsen's 10 Heuristics".</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong class="yellow">LEARNABILITY:</strong> the website is easy to use and the goal easily reached thanks to the search bar immediately on the home page, it is clear to the user how to find a specialist in their city; it is also
                        intuitive learn to navigate between the various sections.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><strong class="yellow">EFFICIENCY:</strong> the process of booking an appointment is quick and easy while the research process is, in some cases, long and repetitive. The video consulting booking service is not very different from
                        the other booking process and that can be confusing.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><strong class="yellow">MEMORABILITY:</strong> the user who returns to use the site could be facilitated by adding the possibility of storing favourites and searches, but given its ease of use, the user can easily return to using it
                        with the same ability after a period of time.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><strong class="yellow">ERRORS:</strong> errors are easily managed and prevented, however it would be useful to implement a FAQs section.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><strong class="yellow">SATISFACTION:</strong> the website provides all the informations necessary to reach the goal of booking a medical appointment in an informed manner and it is pleasant to use.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <h4>In conclusion the website is usable.</h4>
                <p>However, some aspects should be improved, such as: the coherence of the icons and illustrations system, the names of every steps in the search phase and implement implement the FAQs section or a live chat.</p>

            <div class="text-double">
                <h4>TARGET</h4>
                <p>The last part of this first phase was the identification of the target audience, done through user reviews and tools such as Semrush, and the creation of a survey to propose to potential users.<br>The target audience defined for the website
                    have this characteristics:<br> - any gender or social background;<br> - live in italy;<br> - age between 18 and 54;<br> - mobile device users.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-double">
                <h4>COMPETITORS</h4>
                <p>I went on to identify and collect information about iDoctors' competitors, sites that offering a similar service, and then comparing their characteristics. <br> Thanks to this it was possible to find ideas to improve the user experience
                    of the website, such as the possibility of saving favourites bookmarks and allowing user customisation.

                <h4>SURVEY</h4>
                <p>Taking into account all the analysis carried out so far I have decided to create a 10-question survey to understand:<br> - the habits when people have to book a medical service and if this kind of service (not necessarily iDoctors) is
                    known;
                    <br> - what influences people to use this service; <br> - what are the factors that could influence the choice of a specialist.<br><br> The target group for this type of analysis were 63 people over the age of 18, not necessarily users
                    of the platform or other similar services.)<br><br>RESULTS:<br> - users often use websites to book services or a medical visit, in this way they can book that in the shortest possible time;<br> - even users who have never used this
                    type of service know it and would use it, but some are held back by knowledge of digital means;<br> - it is very important for the users to choose by comparing the reviews of other patients;<br> - in order to make an informed choice,
                    the users want to be able to know the profile of the doctor and have information about their specialisations;<br> - it's important to have the possibility of a conversation with the doctor before the visit.
                </p>
                <h4>NEW SITE MAP</h4>
                <p>All of these results brought me to develope a new site map, more clear and easy to navigate:

            <div class="text-center">
                <p>After analysing the opportunities that emerged during the Discovery phase I designed 5 wireframes, inserting and modifying some elements, for improve the user experience of the iDoctors' website.

                    <h4>HOMEPAGE - DESKTOP</h4>
                    <p>I made the Homepage simpler by removing elements that made the process slow and confusing. In the header the search function remains, present on every page, the link to the "You are a doctor" section and the drop-down menu to access
                        your account and view saved specialists, booking history, etc. Then we can find:<br> - the search bar, which allows you to find results only for video consultations or both, and a list of the most requested specialisations, to
                        be able to immediately access the relevant doctors;<br> - the main information on how the site works;<br> - user reviews of the service received.

                    <p>Here we find a list of different specialists with a map showing the locations of the different clinics. The results can be filtered according to certainparameters, including the available date and insurance held, and also sort them
                        according to reviews, price and distance. In each "doctor's card" we find details about the doctor and a user review, then we can continue reading the doctor's profile by clicking on "View profile" or select the desired date and
                        time and proceed with the booking immediately.

                    <h4>DOCTOR'S PROFILE - DESKTOP</h4>
                    <p>In the doctor's profile page we find the resume, organized in section that the user can expand; I decided to treat this part in this way because in the beginning it was long and full of information, while grouping and hiding the parts
                        that the user is not interested in at that moment, everything is clearer and easier to read.<br>After this part we find the reviews of other users who have previously visited by the doctor. At any time the user can book the service
                        he need in the desired date and time.

                    <p>This page also contained a lot of information and it was long and difficult to read, so I used the same treatment as on the previous page: by grouping all the information into sections that the user can expand or reduce when necessary.

                    <p>The "Favourites" section does not exist on the current site, so I decided to add it to allow the user to save some doctors and book a visit with them later. We can access it from the drop-down menu that appears by clicking on the profile
                        image and from here we can book the service or even remove the doctor from the list.

                        from any part of the site, to edit or make a new search;<br> - as the first thing there is a search box from which it is possible to search for the desired visit. The mobile version also offers the possibility to search by type
                        of visit;<br> - then there is all the information on how the service works and the reviews from other users.
